Follow these steps to set up and run the Smart Greenhouse System.

Step 1: Install Python Virtual Environment Tool
First, install the python3-venv package to manage dependencies within a virtual
environment:
sudo apt-get install python3-venv

Step 2: Create Project Directory
Make a directory to store your project files:
